Git Info

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to files over time.
It lets you save snapshots (commits), create branches for experiments, and merge
those changes back together when you are ready.

Why it matters:
- Track history: See what changed and when.
- Work safely: Make changes without losing your working version.
- Collaborate: Share work with others and resolve differences.

Key ideas:
- Repository: The project folder tracked by Git.
- Commit: A saved snapshot of your files.
- Branch: A separate line of work.
- Merge: Combine changes from different branches.
- Remote: A shared copy of the repo used for collaboration.

Common use cases:
- Software projects: track code changes and ship features safely.
- Writing and documentation: compare drafts and keep a clean revision history.
- Design files: review iterations and roll back when needed.
- Research notes: capture experiment changes and preserve context.
- Data and configuration: track changes to datasets, scripts, or settings.
