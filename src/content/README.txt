Welcome to Edu Git!

This is a virtual file system where you can practice Git commands in a safe browser-based environment, explore local and remote workflows, and follow guided tutorials as you learn why Git matters.

Get started:
- Run `git init` in the terminal to create a new repository.
- Open `GIT_CHEAT_SHEET.txt` for a quick list of useful commands.

Workspace Menu (top right):
- Reset Instance: restore the default file system.
- Mock Full Environment: load a full mock project with docs and code files.
- Remote Repo UI: open the remote repo overlay to connect your local repo and learn how remotes impact collaboration.
