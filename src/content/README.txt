Welcome to Edu Git!

This is a virtual file system where you can practice Git commands in a safe browser-based environment, explore local and remote workflows, and follow guided tutorials as you learn why Git matters.

Get started:
- Read `GIT_INFO.txt` for a beginner-friendly overview of Git and version control.
- Open `GIT_CHEAT_SHEET.txt` for a quick list of useful commands.
- Run `git init` in the terminal to create a new repository.
- Use `git status`, `git add`, and `git commit` to build your first history.
- Open the Remote Repo UI to compare branches, practice merge requests, and gain a deeper understanding of remote collaboration.

Workspace Menu (top right):
- Remote Repo UI: open the remote repo overlay to connect your local repo and learn how remotes impact collaboration.
- Export Workspace: download a snapshot of your current workspace.
- Import Workspace: restore a workspace snapshot from file.
- Mock Full Environment: a fully mocked environment including:
  - Project docs and code files.
  - A fully setup Git repo linked to a remote.
  - Multiple branches.
  - An example merge request.
- Reset Instance: restore the default file system.
