Remote repositories in Git

A remote repository is a shared copy of a Git repo that lives somewhere
else, like a server or a hosted platform. It lets multiple people work
on the same project and sync changes through pushes and pulls.

What remotes do:
- Share work: push commits so others can see and fetch them.
- Collaborate: review changes before merging into the main branch.
- Backup: keep a server-side copy of your history.
- Integrate: pull teammates' changes and resolve conflicts.

Common workflows:
- Clone a repo, then pull and push changes.
- Create feature branches locally and push them to the remote.
- Fork a repo when you need your own remote copy to work on.
- Open a merge request to review and merge into main.
- Fetch updates before starting new work.

Key commands:
- git remote -v
- git fetch origin
- git pull origin main
- git push -u origin main
- git clone https://remote.mock/edu-git
