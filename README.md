# Edu Git

Edu Git is a browser-based Git education playground that mimics a lightweight IDE.
Learners can create and edit text files, navigate a file tree, and run terminal-style
commands while preparing for real Git workflows.

## Stack

- React + Vite
- lightning-fs (virtual filesystem for the browser)
- isomorphic-git (real Git behavior in the browser)

## Development

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```
